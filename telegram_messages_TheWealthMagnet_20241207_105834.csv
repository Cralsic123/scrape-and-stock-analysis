🔸 It is 100% OFS. Means offer for sale. Not a single money goes to company. All money from our pocket is going to promoter's pocket. And that too in Korea. So this is big loot of India. 
🔸 Exorbitant rise in dividend payout to the parent by taking money out of cash reserves, just before IPO. Look like captain is jumping out of ship before others🙄
🔸 Sharp increase in royalty payment percentage to the parent, also just before IPO. 
🔸 Launching IPO with full of face component at Big Bull market valuations, while automotive market is struggling.
🔸 Over valued IPO.
🔸 Hyundai sale decreased by 5% in July.
🔸 Peer companies are undervalued and with lower P/E ratio like Tata Motors. 
🔸 This is historically big IPO, so supply is huge. So less chances of listing gain.

Earlier, Bajaj Housing Finance mentioned that there was no upper limit for the Shareholder Quota bid; one could apply up to the total size of the Shareholder Quota, which is ₹500 crore. They also stated that if you applied for more than ₹2 lakh, you would not be eligible to apply in the Retail or HNI categories.

However, the company has now filed an addendum stating that the maximum bid limit in the Shareholder Quota is ₹2 lakh.

The revised scenario will be similar to that of the Tata Tech IPO.
