We recommended buying JSW Holdings at a price-to-book (PB) multiple of 0.3 in June 2024. SEBI had announced a special call auction session for holding companies. The final list which the exchange published didn’t include JSW Holdings for the special call auction session but the stock has still managed to move up. 
The stock is currently trading at PB multiple of almost 0.5. The multiple is not stretched and the stock still has further potential for upside till 20,000 levels. However, we believe that 50% upside in 3 days warrants for a profit booking.

In our Positional Stock Option Strategy, we shared 16 recommendations, resulting in 7 gains and 9 losses. The strike rate stands at 43.7%, with an average gain of -0.9%, totalling an overall loss of 2,485. 

Option premiums experienced significant fluctuations, with prices standing and reversing within minutes, making it challenging to capitalize on profits. Overall, the trend largely followed our analysis, but instant swings in premiums and theta decay, as implied volatility shrank, contributed to the losses.
Despite the challenging last month our performance in the last three months was solid with total gains of Rs 22,028 if you traded one lot for each recommendation we made.

We opted mostly not to carry trades due to heightened volatility and making quick adjustments and early profit booking crucial.
The market has shifted from bullish to bearish, complicating stock and strike selection due to sharply rising delta values. We must be cautious in the coming months, as high swings in stocks and constantly changing trends will significantly impact premiums.

A balanced approach involving riding bullish trends with calls and bearish trends with puts is the key to success in stock options trading. We maintain our stance of booking early profits to capitalize on market movements efficiently. This strategy enables traders to remain active in response to the prevailing market trends.

We booked profits in 7 and closed 11 in negative. Our strike rate remains at 38.9% monthly average monthly gain stands at a modest -0.40%.
The primary driver of our losses stemmed from significant price swings during morning trades, which shifted momentum from profit to loss. To address this, we will refine our stock selection process and be more proactive in exiting positions, as many stocks initially surged before either consolidating or trending downward. We also encountered several false breakouts that hindered us from capitalizing on emerging trends.
October presented challenges that resulted in a drawdown, but we had notable successes with Poly Medicure Ltd and RPG Life Sciences Ltd, which delivered impressive returns of 11.68% and 9.88%, respectively. Conversely, Tata Chemicals Ltd emerged as the month's underperformer.
The majority of stocks remained below their 20-day and 50-day moving averages, complicating trend-following strategies. Moving forward, we will prioritize identifying critical support levels and utilizing indicators such as Bollinger Bands, along with a heightened focus on volume and bullish divergence in our stock selection process to spot reversal trades.
The India VIX is above the 15 level, we anticipate heightened volatility in the coming month. We will remain vigilant and emphasize early profit booking to mitigate risks. Another area we will focus on is recommend only extremely high conviction trading ideas. As market dynamics evolve, we are committed to adjusting our approach to navigate the shifting landscape effectively.

2024-11-05 12:15:27+00:00,-1001156495705,"Delivery Trading Pick: October 2024: Small & Midcaps Take the Spotlight 

In October 2024, the Indian stock market faced a turbulent month, with small and midcap stocks at the center of activity. The RBI’s decision to maintain the repo rate at 6.5% helped stabilize market sentiment in the month’s start. Smallcaps and midcaps faced heavy selling pressure as foreign investors offloaded over Rs. 1,00,000 crore, leading to heightened volatility and significant losses. Interest in gold surged amid global uncertainties, signaling a shift toward safe-haven assets. By month-end, the small and midcaps rebounded slightly, yet elevated volatility indicated a cautious market outlook moving forward.

Now let us examine the performance of our strategy for the month…
In October 2024, we issued one recommendation in our Delivery Trading Pick. Despite the market’s volatility, five of our recommended stocks ended the month on a positive note. However, we exited our positions in Jain Irrigation Systems and Ashoka Buildcon as they hit their stop-loss levels during the month.

We have recommended 88 stocks employing this strategy to date, with 8 of these trades still active. Although our success rate of 51% might look lower, our average gain is still positive indicating that the profitable recommendations make up for the losing trades. We have even made changes to our model, which will likely improve our success rate going forward. 

Our overall average gain was significantly impacted on account of stocks hitting stop-loss levels due to high volatility witnessed by small and midcaps. To navigate high-volatility environments, we have adjusted our strategy to hold stocks for three months with a 20% stop-loss. This approach is designed to limit risks while optimizing returns. 

The average gain for Delivery Trading Picks is approximately 4.50%, achieved within an average holding period of only 47 days. When annualized, this equates to an average gain of approximately 35%. 

We remain committed to providing precise entry prices and stop-loss levels. 

Our primary objective is to maximize the potential for enhancing your investments and consistently aim to outperform the benchmark index, regardless of market conditions. We invite you to join us in this journey to seize short-term opportunities and optimize your investments.

Here’s the performance of all recommendations closed till September 2024.
Thank You!"

In October, the Indian equity market faced significant bearish pressure, with the Nifty 50 index declining by 1,605 points, marking a drawdown of -6.22%. The India VIX surged past the 15 level on a monthly closing basis for the first time in four months, signaling heightened volatility and increasing risk aversion among investors. These factors had a modest negative impact on our holdings, leading to a 3% decline in the strategy’s average returns compared to the previous month.
Under our value pick strategy, we aim to identify stocks with strong fundamentals offering significant upside potential which are trading below their book value. Purchasing stocks below their intrinsic value gives us a substantial margin of safety, allowing us to maximize returns with low risk.

Now let us examine our Value Pick strategy performance in October 2024.
Under our Value Pick strategy, we recommended to buy Vindhya Telelinks, which engaged in the manufacturing and distribution of diverse cable products, including telecom cables, FRP rods, and glass rovings. It holds stakes in notable companies like Birla Cable Ltd, Birla Corporation Ltd, and Universal Cable Ltd., contributing to its robust investment portfolio valued at approximately ₹1,474 crore with a market cap of ₹2,545 crore. Trading at an attractive price-to-book multiple of 0.63 and a price-to-earnings multiple of 10 it provides a margin of safety to enter at such low valuation.

SEBI conducted a special auction session this month for holding companies, which led to heightened volatility in their share prices. We already recommended four holding companies, of which NSIL and PILANIINVS saw a significant rally this month, rising 26% and 20%, respectively. We believe that following SEBI's special auction session, holding companies are likely to witness further value unlocking, potentially leading to rising share prices in the near future.

Our current strategy recommendations comprise 14 active positions, with 9 trading above the recommended entry levels, reflecting a strategy strike rate of 67%. 
The strategy’s average gain stands at an impressive 16.26%. Out of the active positions Century Enka remained the top performer with a gain of 42.45%, followed by NSIL and JSWHL, delivering returns of 36.18% and 35.39%, respectively. 

We appreciate your continued engagement with the Value Pick plan and look forward to sharing more such opportunities with you in the months ahead. Stay tuned…

In October, the Nifty index posted a subdued 6.22% drop amidst heightened volatility, reaching a monthly low of 24,073 and a high of 25,907. Both Nifty and Bank Nifty experienced sharp selloffs from the month’s outset, failing to show any recovery as sellers-maintained control throughout. The downturn stemmed largely from disappointing Q2 earnings and a sustained net selling trend by Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs). Major stocks also saw intensified profit-booking, with both indices failing to hold critical support levels.

Index Buying Strategy Performance: In October, our Index Buying Strategy delivered notable results, achieving an overall strike rate of 65% across 20 recommended trades. The breakdown of results is as follows:
Bank Nifty: 1 trade (1 winner)
Fin Nifty: 2 trades (1 winner, 1 loser)
Nifty: 14 trades (9 winners, 5 losers)
Midcap Nifty: 3 trades (2 winners, 1 loser)

The strategy achieved an average gain of 3.47% per trade, resulting in a total profit of ₹10,180 per lot traded. Strong risk management was key to these results, with winning trades yielding an average return of ₹1,135, while losses averaged ₹653.

Outlook for November: As we move into November, we’ll adopt a more cautious approach in light of increased market volatility and muted option premium momentum. The market has been opening with significant gaps, impacting intraday momentum and increasing the frequency of stop-loss hits. To navigate this, we’ll adjust our strategy to align with the heightened volatility, focusing on capturing precise intraday moves.

While challenges remain, we are optimistic about capitalizing on momentum shifts and maintaining robust performance. Our strategy will continue to evolve to meet market demands and deliver consistent results.

Thank you for your trust in our approach. We look forward to another successful month ahead."

October proved challenging for the Indian equity market. The Nifty index declined by around 2000 points from its peak within almost a month. This broad market downturn was driven by FII sell-offs, with over ₹1 lakh crore withdrawn on a net basis in October. The market was also influenced by Q2 earnings results and speculation around demand uptick in the festive season in select industries.

The Nifty 500 strategy universe also saw a decline of over 6% during the month, breaking its eleven-month positive return trajectory. Our recommendations were similarly impacted by prevailing market uncertainty.

We exited positions in Vardhman Textiles Ltd., Rites Ltd., Alok Industries Ltd., and PNC Infratech Ltd. due to stop-loss triggers. Additionally, after completing the one-year holding period, we booked gains in Metro Brands Ltd. (0.90%), Godrej Industries Ltd. (60.00%), and Bombay Burmah Trading Corporation Ltd. (85.21%).

We made three new recommendations in October 2024, and their performance is detailed in the table above: 

Among our live positions in the Positional Trading Pick, Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd. (28.20%) and Amber Enterprises India Ltd. (27.24%) were the top gainers, while PCBL (-26.42%) provided the lowest return for the month.

Although the strategy’s average gain declined from 34.06% last month to 30.52% since inception, it remains resilient with a strike rate of 64.37% (56/87 stocks).
(Note: Returns are based on the last traded prices as of 1st November 2024.)

Several significant events are upcoming this month, including the US elections, a Fed meeting with a potential rate cut, and the release of Q2 earnings for many companies. It remains to be seen whether FII flows will return to Indian equities, setting the Nifty on a renewed bullish trajectory or prompting further corrections.
Hold firmly to investments you have conviction in during this market turbulence, as the current volatility will eventually subside, likely boosting the value of your investments.

Thank you!"

Maximizing Returns with Precision-Driven, Momentum Picks

At Momentum Pick, we focus on identifying stocks with strong quarterly results and an upward price trend. Our approach combines fundamental insights with technical indicators, helping us find companies with solid earnings and steady growth. By using this method, we have a track record of spotting top-performing sectors—like construction equipment makers in Q3FY24, auto parts manufacturers in Q4FY24, and pharmaceutical and consumer goods companies in Q1FY25.
This reliable strategy allows us to find new opportunities in any market environment, aiming to deliver the best possible returns to you. We’re committed to keeping you informed, so let’s take a look at our recent stock recommendations

With the release of Q2FY25 results, several companies have met our fundamental selection criteria. However, due to current market conditions, the momentum criteria are yet to be fully realized for some stocks. Nevertheless, we’ve initiated a few fresh recommendations based on Q2FY25 performance, including Manorama Industries, Persistent Systems, Sun Pharma, and Poly Medicure.

Recent market volatility has triggered stop-losses for some of our previous recommendations, such as KPIT Tech, Rattan India, and Selan Exploration, despite KPIT Tech and Selan posting robust Q2FY25 results.

Our recommendations based on Q2FY25 results have shown strong performance, with notable gains in:
• Poly Medicure: +16.28% (in 2 days)
• Manorama Industries: +7.21% (in 3 days)

While these gains underscore the strength of our approach, a few stocks underperformed, with Persistent Systems and Sun Pharma experiencing losses of 4.5% and 0.59%, respectively.

Additionally, CAMS, a recommendation from February 2024, continues to merit holding for another quarter due to its consistent, high-quality results, delivering a return of 56.33% to date.

Despite some challenges, our Q2FY25-based recommendations have achieved an average return of 4.6%, demonstrating the resilience and adaptability of our strategy.

Despite recent market challenges, our live trades since their respective recommendation dates have achieved an average return of 7.23%, translating to an impressive annualized return of 35.07%. This performance underscores the resilience and effectiveness of our strategy. However, the average return of all open recommendations from previous months in October 2024 was -3.23%, reflecting the impact of broader market conditions during the month."

Indian stock markets are down by 5% from its all time high of 26,277🔽

Factors like funds moving to China from India SEBI's crackdown on derivatives trading are cited as reasons for the market decline

The prime factor touted is the recent escalation of war in the Middle East with Iran attacking Israel. TA-35 which is the benchmark index of Israel is still trading within 2.5% of its ATH. The index is up by more than 33% since Israel invaded Gaza almost a year ago.

We believe that unlike what is claimed our markets have not fallen because of the escalation but because they had run up too far too soon and stretched valuations. Healthy corrections like these are necessary to keep the bull market intact. 

We expect this blip to be temporary before the index picks up momentum and start hitting ATH soon

At Momentum Pick, our investment strategy is centered on identifying stocks that demonstrate both strong quarterly financial performance and a sustained upward price trend. By integrating fundamental analysis with technical indicators, we aim to consistently deliver robust returns through the selection of companies that exhibit solid earnings growth and positive price momentum.

Looking ahead to the upcoming Q2FY25 results season, we anticipate continued strong performance in the pharmaceutical sector. Additionally, Metals and IT stocks are key areas to monitor, as these sectors are expected to post positive results.

Our approach’s strength lies in its ability to automatically screen and identify companies likely to perform well in the near term. Over the past year, this methodology has allowed us to pinpoint high-performing sectors with precision. 

For example, in Q3FY24, we successfully identified opportunities in construction equipment manufacturers, followed by automobile component manufacturers in Q4FY24. In Q1FY25, pharmaceutical companies and select consumer durables emerged as high-potential sectors.

This track record of identifying sectoral shifts underscores the reliability of our strategy. It positions us to consistently capture opportunities regardless of broader market conditions, ensuring that we remain well-positioned to deliver superior returns.

In September, our live recommendations delivered returns exceeding 3.5%, outperforming both the Nifty Midcap 150, which yielded 1.76%, and the Nifty Small Cap 250, which grew by 1.32%. This notable outperformance highlights the resilience and effectiveness of our strategy, as previously mentioned.
As part of our ongoing commitment to transparency, we would like to highlight the performance of our recent stock recommendations.

In September 2024, we recommended only one stock, Arrow Greentech, which yielded a return of -5.65% over 25 days. However, our recommendations based on Q1FY25 results has demonstrated exceptional performance in a few of our other recommendations:
Himadri Specialty Chemicals: +53.7%
PG Electroplast: +53.1%
Anant Raj: +26.46%

While we achieved strong gains with these stocks, there were also a few laggards. Rattan India Enterprises and Selan Exploration posted negative returns of 16.1% and 14.59%, respectively. Additionally, one stock, Adani Ports & SEZ, hit its stop-loss, resulting in a 9.9% loss.

Despite these challenges, the average return from all our trades based on Q1FY25 results stands at 9.34%, reflecting the overall strength of our strategy.
A February 2024 recommendation, CAMS, remains active, generating a strong yield of 52.6% to date. Furthermore, stocks from previous quarters such as Havells, Balkrishna Industries, and Lumax Auto Technologies continue to perform well and remain in positive territory. However, KPIT is still trading at a loss, and we are closely monitoring its trajectory.

With a six-month holding period, we aim to enhance portfolio performance and consistently outperform the index. We invite you to explore these medium-term opportunities to maximize your investment potential.
Thank You"

Nifty 500 marked a new high of 24,573.40 and settled at 24,245.20, up 2.15% in September, marking its 11th consecutive monthly gain. The index displays a higher high and higher low in the weekly time frame. 

In our Swing Trading Strategy, we recommended 17 stocks. We booked profits in 9 and closed7 in negative with one recommendation remaining open. Our monthly average gains stand at -0.20%. 

We will be refining our stock selection process and would be more prompt in exiting our positions because most of the stock first surged higher and then consolidated or moved lower. Additionally, we’ll be more selective in high-beta stocks and adapt to revising stops. 

Unfortunately, September presented some challenges that resulted in a drawdown, contrasting with the stronger performance we experienced in the previous months. 

Reliance Infrastructure Ltd  and Uno Minda Ltd were the best performers, delivering returns of 18.66% and 6.45% respectively while Ola Electric Mobility Ltd remains the underperformer for the month. In September, we opted mostly small-cap and mid-caps which had higher volumes and liquidity.

In the coming month, we would maintain a broad focus across sectors but Pharma, Metals, and PSUs preferably would be on our radar.  Currently, most of the Nifty 500 stocks are trading above their 50 DMA, signalling strong market momentum. However, we will remain vigilant and emphasize early profit booking in high-beta stocks. 

As market dynamics evolve, we will adjust our approach accordingly. 
Happy trading!"

Nifty crossed the 26,000 mark, reaching a new lifetime high of 26,277.35 and settled at 25,810.5.  The Nifty ended September with a 2.28% monthly gain. The US market also remained positive in September and our domestic market followed the trend, which boosted investor confidence.  

In our Positional Stock Option Strategy, we shared 12 recommendations, resulting in 7 gains and 5 losses. The strike rate stands at 58.3% and with an average gain of 6.22%, i.e., Rs. 15,735 per lot. In the last 3 months the gains realised per lot would have been Rs. 40,811. 

The average gain from winning trades remains at 25.35% while average losses from losing trades remained at 20.56%. Since the number of winners and their absolute gains is higher than loser our recommendations delivered a strong performance.  

Option premiums experienced significant swings, especially in high-beta stocks. In the early days of the September series.  The premiums expanded sharply due to elevated implied volatility (IV), increasing costs for both call and put buyers. Traders carrying positions for 1-2 days encountered challenges and quick adjustments and booking early profits became crucial.

The current market is in an extremely bullish phase, with no negative monthly closes on Nifty over the past four months, and Nifty has risen approximately 18% year-to-date. 

However, there would be sector-specific corrections, particularly in the Infrastructure and Energy sectors. It will be closely monitored, as they may bring key stocks into focus and opportunities for traders. 

A balanced approach involving riding bull trends with calls and bearish trends with puts is the key to success in stock options trading. We maintain our stance of recommending early profit booking and timely exits to capitalize on market movements efficiently. This approach keeps traders nimble in the ongoing bull run.

We thank you for being a part of our Positional Stock Option strategy."

The market reflected a noteworthy bullish sentiment in September, as Nifty reached all-time high levels eleven times out of the twenty-one trading days during the month and surpassed the 26,000 milestone. Nifty 500, the index representing the universe of our strategy, ended positive for the eleventh consecutive month. However, the month concluded with some profit booking. The strong momentum in the broader market also manifested in the performance of our recommendations, as we experienced several instances of shares rising by over 10% in a single day.

Moreover, upon completing the one-year holding period, we realized phenomenal gains in four stocks during the month: MMTC Ltd. (80.37%), ITI Ltd. (82.50%), Blue Star Ltd. (116.63%), and Housing & Urban Development Corporation Ltd. (181.93%). (NCC Ltd., which was closed on 2nd September 2024, was included in the previous month's performance update.)

We made five new recommendations in September 2024, and their performance is detailed in the table above
Among our live positions under the Positional Trading Pick, Cholamandalam Financial Holdings Ltd. (28.03%) and Jubilant Pharmova Ltd. (24.03%) were the largest gainers in September 2024, while BLS International Services Ltd. (-13.07%) and TV18 Broadcast Ltd. (-13.04%) provided the lowest returns for the month.
Our strategy has achieved an impressive average gain of 34.06% since inception, with a strike rate of 65.48% (55/84 stocks).
(Note: The last traded prices as of 30th September 2024 are considered for the return calculation.)

Although the market is currently trending upward, it's important to note that the cost of acquisition is higher. This may lead to temporary negative returns in recent new entries due to some correction after the strong rally. However, the outlook remains bullish for the one-year holding period.

We appreciate the trust you’ve placed in following our strategy’s recommendations. Above all, congratulations on realizing profits in two multi-bagger stocks in September.

In September, the Nifty index posted a solid 2.28% gain despite heightened volatility throughout the month. The index reached a monthly high of 26,277 and a low of 24,753, following an All-Time High (ATH) early in the month. Both Nifty and Bank Nifty faced a sharp selloff in the first two weeks, with each correcting nearly 2.50%. However, the decline was short lived, and both indices quickly recovered to hit new ATHs.

In the final two trading sessions, both indices faced profit booking, with an almost 2.00% drop in each index. Nifty witnessed a smaller correction (-1.80%) compared to Bank nifty (-2.80%), but intraday momentum remained volatile, creating traps for traders with sudden and uncertain moves.

Index Buying Strategy Results – September
Under our Index Buying Strategy, we recommended 16 trades in September, achieving a 63% overall strike rate. The breakdown of results is as follows:
•  Bank Nifty: 3 trades (all losers)
•  Fin Nifty: 4 trades (2 winners, 2 losers)
•  Nifty: 8 trades (7 winners, 1 loser)
•  Midcap Nifty: 1 trade (1 winner)

The strategy delivered an average gain of 8.40%, generating a total profit of ₹5,339 per lot traded. Strong risk management was key to this performance. On average, the winning trades returned ₹900, while losing trades incurred an average loss of ₹607.

Outlook for October
As we move into October, a more cautious approach will be adopted due to increased market volatility and subdued momentum in option premiums. The market has been opening with significant gaps, leading to reduced intraday momentum and frequent stop-loss hunts. To adapt, we will fine-tune our strategy to align with these volatile conditions, focusing on capturing the right intraday moves with precision.

Despite the challenges, we remain optimistic about capitalizing on momentum shifts and maintaining strong performance. We will continue to adapt to market changes to deliver consistent results.

Thank you for your trust in our strategy. We look forward to delivering another successful month ahead."

The September month witnessed a strong bullish momentum in the markets, with the Nifty 50 surpassing the key 26,000 level before closing at 25,810.85, marking a robust 2.28% rise for the month. With the broader market hitting new all-time highs, we have observed a significant increase in valuations, which has left us with limited stocks to recommend. 

Under our value pick strategy, we aim to identify stocks with strong fundamentals offering significant upside potential which are trading below their book value. Purchasing stocks below their intrinsic value gives us a substantial margin of safety, allowing us to maximize returns with low risk.

Now let us examine our Value Pick strategy performance in September 2024.
In line with our disciplined value investing approach, we made no new recommendations this month, as none of the stocks met our fundamental entry criteria. However, rest assure that we remain highly vigilant and focused on uncovering the next set of value stocks that align with our strategy rule.

Our strategy has identified four holding company stocks, which have gathered significant investor attention ahead of the special call auction session to be scheduled in October. This has resulted in an upward trend for holding companies’ stocks, and we believe this session can unlock additional value and generate higher yields in the coming month. We advise you to stay invested and hold strong, as these stocks continue to present substantial upside potential.

Looking back at monthly performance, our strategy delivered robust returns. By the end of the month, 8 out of our 13 active recommendations ended in positive territory, achieving a strike rate of 64%. These stocks recorded an average gain of 19.25%, reflecting the strength of our value pick strategy.

We appreciate your continued engagement with the Value Pick plan and look forward to sharing more such opportunities with you in the months ahead. Stay tuned…"

In September 2024, Indian markets saw a mix of highs and volatility. The broader market indices touched new highs, closing on a positive note for the month. The India VIX hit a 1.5-year low at 8.98, indicating reduced market fear. However, Smallcaps and Midcaps experienced selling pressure, especially in the first half, as investors remained cautious ahead of the U.S. Federal Reserve’s potential rate cut. Mid-month, the market regained momentum, and volatility eased after the Fed implemented a 50 basis points (bps) rate cut, providing a boost to investor sentiment.

Now let us examine the performance of our strategy for the month...
We issued four recommendations in our Delivery Trading Picks during September 2024. Despite market volatility, we achieved gains of 48% in VMart Retail, 37% in Sansera Engineering, and 23% in Bharti Airtel. However, we exited Texmaco Rail at a loss during the month.

We have recommended 87 stocks employing this strategy to date, with 9 of these trades still active. Although our success rate of 51% might look lower, our average gain is still positive indicating that the profitable recommendations make up for the losing trades. We have even made changes to our model, which will likely improve our success rate going forward. 

Our overall average gain was significantly impacted on account of stocks hitting stop-loss levels due to high volatility on election result day and final budget day. To navigate high-volatility environments, we have adjusted our strategy to hold stocks for three months with a 20% stop-loss. This approach is designed to limit risks while optimizing returns. 

The average gain for Delivery Trading Picks is approximately 4.98%, achieved within an average holding period of only 44 days. When annualized, this equates to an average gain of approximately 41%. 

Among our active positions, two of our recommended stocks, Saregama and HEG have generated returns of 27% and 8% in 49 days and 11 days respectively.
We remain committed to providing precise entry prices and stop-loss levels. 

Our primary objective is to maximize the potential for enhancing your investments and consistently aim to outperform the benchmark index, regardless of market conditions. We invite you to join us in this journey to seize short-term opportunities and optimize your investments.

Here’s the performance of all recommendations closed till August 2024."

2024-09-03 05:32:45+00:00,-1001156495705,"Momentum Trading Pick: Aug 2024 Performance 📊 

At Momentum Pick our strategy targets stocks that exhibit strong quarterly performance coupled with a sustained positive price trend. This dual focus combines technicals and fundamentals to deliver solid returns by picking companies that have robust earnings and price movement. 

The companies have recently concluded their results for the first quarter of FY25. Notably, pharmaceutical companies have reported their best-ever quarterly sales and profits, alongside the highest operating profit margins seen in several quarters.

The cornerstone of our approach lies in its ability to automatically screen and identify companies that are likely to perform well in the near future. Over the past year, this strategy has allowed us to pinpoint high-performing sectors with remarkable accuracy. For instance:
• In Q3FY24, we observed a significant number of construction equipment manufacturers showing strong potential.
• In Q4FY24, the focus shifted to automobile parts component manufacturers, who delivered impressive results.
• Now, in Q1FY25, pharmaceutical companies and a few consumer durable companies have emerged as the standout performers.

This ability to identify promising companies across different sectors, much like sectoral rotation, allows us to consistently capture opportunities irrespective of broader market conditions.

Now let us examine the performance of our strategy for the month…
We would also like to highlight the performance of our recent recommendations. In August 2024, we proposed five key stock recommendations. Among these, PG Electroplast yielded the highest return of 25.95% in just 28 days, while Lupin provided a return of 4.8% in 3 days. However, not all recommendations were positive, as RattanIndia Enterprises and Adani Ports & SEZ recorded losses of 12.69% and 5.9%, respectively. MOIL which was recommended recently had hit stop-loss, generated a yield of -9.62%.

The average return from all the recommended trades during the month was 3.02%. 

Recommendation given in the month of February-24 is still live i.e., CAMS generating a yield of 48.1% till date continue to deliver exceptional results in Q1FY25 also. 
Few recommendations of Q4FY24 which continued their quarterly out-performance in Sales and PAT are Balkrishna Industries, KPIT technologies.
The strategy has generated an average return of 7.89% since inception i.e., 52.85% annualized returns upon conversion.

Our strategy is centered on delivering precise entry and stop-loss points, driven by a combination of earnings strength and price momentum. Stocks selected under this approach are typically held for a six-month period, reflecting our commitment to accuracy and sustained growth.

Our primary objective is to enhance your portfolio's performance and consistently outperform the index through our Momentum Picks. We invite you to take advantage of these medium-term opportunities and unlock the full potential of your investments

Thank You"

August month witnessed a mixed emotion for investors, with Nifty showing moderate volatility. The index closed at 25,235.90, gaining 1.14%. Despite the market fluctuations, our value pick strategy remained resilient, successfully identifying opportunities that align with our criteria of strong attractive valuations.
Under our value pick strategy, we aim to identify stocks with strong fundamentals offering significant upside potential which are trading below their book value. Purchasing stocks below their intrinsic value gives us a substantial margin of safety, allowing us to maximize the returns with low risk.

Now let us examine our Value Pick strategy performance in August 2024.

In August 2024, we added 4 new stocks to our portfolio. We recommended Sheela Foam Ltd (SFL) which was trading at a 62% discount to its 7-year average price-to-book value. The company holds about 29% of the Indian branded modern mattress market and has the potential to grow further in future. 

We also recommended three holding companies: Maharashtra Scooter, Nalwa Sons Investments, and Pilani Investment and Industries Ltd. These stocks are trading significantly below their book value. SEBI's new framework for investment in holding companies, aimed at improving price discovery through special call auctions is set for October 2024 and has sparked investor interest, leading to a rally in these stocks.

Currently, we have 13 active positions out of which 9 are trading above the recommended price. The current strike rate of our strategy is 64%, with an average portfolio gain of 15.95% with the CENTENKA being the highest gainer in the portfolio with a gain of 76.44%. 

We appreciate your continued engagement with the Value Pick portfolio and look forward to sharing more such opportunities with you in the months ahead. Stay tuned…"

2024-09-03 04:41:42+00:00,-1001156495705,"August 2024 Performance - Swing Trader Strategy📊

Nifty 500 marked a new high of 23,766.40 and settled at 23,734.55, up 0.87% in August, marking its tenth consecutive monthly gain. 
In our Swing Trading Strategy, we recommended 21 stocks, securing profits in 15 of them, while 6 ended in negative, resulting in an overall success rate of 71.4%, with an average gain of 1.00%

TATAELXSI and TATATECH were the best performers, delivering returns of 8.45% and 6.67% respectively while TATAINVEST remains the underperformer for the month. 

In August, we strategically shifted towards small-cap stocks, driven by higher volumes and liquidity. As we enter September- historically a volatile month, with Nifty and Nifty 500 often delivering negative returns, our focus will shift back to large mid-caps and blue-chip companies. 

Presently, most Nifty 500 stocks are trading above their 50 DMA, but we remain vigilant. We'll adapt to the changes in market dynamics and make the necessary changes in the strategy for better stock identification. We will also aim to standardize our approach by seeking stronger confirmation through volume analysis, stronger pattern recognition, and ensuring that breakout levels are sustained

In these conditions, employing trailing stops becomes crucial to safeguard capital, a strategy we cannot overlook.

Happy trading!"

Nifty crossed the psychological 25,000 mark, hitting a new lifetime high of 25,268.35 before settling at 25,235.90.  The Nifty ended with a 1.14% monthly gain. The global market traded with a positive bias which boosted the domestic indices for the month.

In our Positional Stock Option Segment Strategy, we shared 21 recommendations, resulting in 9 gainers and 12 losers. This yielded a 42.8% strike rate and an average gain of 0.81%, concluding with a total gain of Rs. 1,144/-

The previous month posed significant challenges due to heightened volatility in premiums. Frequent spikes in the market resulted in initial losses but by the end of the month, we successfully sailed through the tough times and ultimately turned profitable.

Historically, September has also been a highly volatile month as Nifty has delivered negative returns in six out of the last 10 years. This makes the coming month very crucial. We plan to limit our open positions at the beginning of the month. We will be nimble and not shy away from booking our positions earlier than usual if they don""t move as expected. Sometimes, a dynamic approach proves to be more effective.

We thank you for being a part of our Positional Stock Option strategy.

2024-09-02 12:26:35+00:00,-1001156495705,"AUGUST 2024 PERFORMANCE: INDEX OPTION BUYING STRATEGY📊

In August, the Nifty index experienced a notable increase of 1.14%. The month was characterized by extreme market volatility, particularly following the All-Time High (ATH) at the start of the month. Both the Nifty and Bank Nifty indices underwent a strong selloff in the first three days, with each experiencing an almost 4% correction. Despite this initial downturn, the selloff was short-lived, leading both indices to enter a range-bound phase for nearly two weeks.

By mid-August, the Nifty index began its recovery, culminating in a new ATH of 25,268. Conversely, Bank Nifty showed lower momentum, trading mostly sideways in a narrow range. This divergence between the two indices created several intraday momentum traps.

Index Buying Strategy Results
We recommended 25 trades under our Index Buying Strategy in August, achieving an overall strike rate of 72%. Out of the 25 trades:
• Bank Nifty: 8 trades (4 winners, 4 losers)
• Fin Nifty: 7 trades (6 winners, 1 loser)
• Nifty: 9 trades (7 winners, 2 losers)
• Midcap Nifty: 1 trade (1 winner)

The strategy delivered an average gain of 3.18%, resulting in a total profit of ₹15,851 for each lot traded. This success can be attributed to sound risk management. On average, the winners posted a profit of ₹1,100, while the losers incurred an average loss of ₹1,050.

September Strategy and Outlook:
As we move into September, our approach will be more cautious due to the ongoing divergence between the indices over the past two months. The market has been creating significant gaps at the open, leading to reduced momentum throughout the day and frequent stop-loss hunts during intraday trading. To adapt to these conditions, we will shift our strategy to better align with a sideways market. Our focus will be on identifying the right moments to capitalize on momentum by selecting the appropriate index. If market conditions remain favorable, we aim to capture significant intraday moves.

Our commitment is to stay adaptable and responsive to market changes, ensuring continued strong results for you. As we look ahead, we remain optimistic and determined to sustain momentum, with a strategic approach to navigating market fluctuations.

Thank you for your continued trust in our strategy. We look forward to delivering another successful month."

2024-09-02 11:22:38+00:00,-1001156495705,"Delivery Trading Pick: August 2024 Performance📊

Small-cap and mid-cap stocks had a rough start in August 2024, with market volatility spiking significantly, as seen by India VIX jumping 42% on August 05, 2024 mainly led by yen carry trade related unwinding. However, the markets began to stabilize in August’s second half, with Nifty Smallcap 100 and Nifty Midcap 100 indices recording modest gains of 0.89% and 0.50% respectively during the month.

Now let us examine the performance of our strategy for the month…
We issued five recommendations within our Delivery Trading Picks during August 2024. Despite the heightened volatility, our recommendations exhibited resilience, and we maintained our positions without exiting any stocks.

We have recommended 83 stocks employing this strategy to date, with 9 of these trades still active. Although our success rate of 53% might look lower but our average gains is still positive indicating that the recommendations which are profitable make up for the losing trades. We have even made changes to our model which is likely to improve our success rate going forward. 

Our overall average gain was significantly impacted on account of stocks hitting stop-loss levels due to high volatility on election result day and final budget day. To navigate high-volatility environments, we have adjusted our strategy to hold stocks for three months with a 20% stop-loss. This approach is designed to limit risks while optimizing returns. 

The average gain for Delivery Trading Picks stands at approximately 5.20%, achieved within an average holding period of merely 44 days. When annualized, this equates to a remarkable average gain of approximately 44%. 

Among our live positions, two of our recommended stocks (VMart & Sansera Engineering) have delivered returns of over 45% each in less than 3 months.
We remain committed to providing precise entry prices and stop-loss levels. 

Our primary objective is to maximize the potential for enhancing your investments and consistently aim to outperform the benchmark index, regardless of market conditions. We invite you to join us in this journey to seize short-term opportunities and optimize your investments.

Here’s the performance of all recommendations closed till July 2024."

2024-08-03 09:09:26+00:00,-1001156495705,"Momentum Trading Pick: July 2024 Performance📊

The markets had many events during the month. One among the few being recent budget announcement which sent shockwaves through the markets.
 
The Nifty Index plummeted by 327 points during the budget speech, and bounced back sharply by 210 points, illustrating a day of significant volatility. This tumultuous market behavior kept participants on their toes. Even precious metals like gold and silver experienced notable declines, with gold dropping 5.79% and silver falling 4.8%, defying their traditional safe-haven status.

Further compounding the volatility, the company earnings and SEBI’s consultation paper aimed at curbing F&O speculations introduced additional uncertainty. On a month-to-month basis, the Nifty Index demonstrated resilience with a 2.94% increase while the Bank Nifty lagged, declining by 1.9%. Other broader market indices showed positive movement with the Midcap 150 Index rising by 3.17 % and the Small Cap 250 Index advancing by 3.29%. 

In our Momentum Pick strategy, we focus on stocks that demonstrate robust quarterly performance and a positive price trend. This dual approach not only highlights effective management execution but also reflects market validation through the upward movement of stock prices.

Now let us examine the performance of our strategy for the month…
We proposed 8 recommendations, with HSCL yielding the highest returns with 8.6%, followed by & KPIT Technologies with 7.61% within 32 days and 15 days respectively. Further, Anant Raj & MOIL ended with -6.11% and -4.81% respectively.
The average return from all recommended trades last month was 1.85%.

The strategy has generated an average return of 9.82% since inception i.e., 79.3% annualized returns upon conversion.

We focus only in providing exact entry and stop-loss points based on earnings and price momentum. Stocks selected under this strategy are typically held for six months, reflecting our emphasis on precision and sustained growth.

Our primary aim is to enhance your investments and outperform the index with our Momentum Picks. We invite you to join us in capitalizing on medium-term opportunities and maximizing your investment potential.

Thank You!"

The index negated all concerns before the budget and moved higher, with most sectors outperforming and led by the Mid-Cap and Small-Cap indices. The India VIX dropped significantly to 13.25 after the key event, boosting the bullish confidence.

In our Swing Trading Strategy, we recommended 18 stocks, booking profits in 11 and closing 6 with losses due to gap-down openings or sudden swings from ongoing quarterly earnings, while 1 position remains open. Our monthly average gains stand at 1.76%.

TATAMTRDVR and ATFL were the best performers, delivering returns of 12.27% and 10.34% respectively while BAJEL remains the underperformer for the month. 

For the next month, we will focus primarily on mid-cap and large-cap stocks, considering the rotational shift in sectors. Additionally, we will consider the global cues and will be cautious of taking higher exposure.

2024-08-03 07:54:40+00:00,-1001156495705,"July 2024 Performance – Value Picks!

In July, the release of Q1FY25 earnings results increased investor attention on the market. The finance minister presented the union budget this month; the precious metals witnessed a substantial decline on a budget day followed by an upward trajectory. Meanwhile, the market climbed to a new high, with the Nifty 50 index closing at 24,717 on a notable gain of 2.94%.

Under our value pick strategy, we aim to identify stocks with strong fundamentals offering significant upside potential which are trading below their book value. Purchasing stocks below their intrinsic value gives us a substantial margin of safety, allowing us to maximize the returns with low-risk

Now let us examine our Value Pick strategy performance in July 2024.
Due to the soaring market valuations and narrowing margins of safety, no stocks met our stringent value criteria this month. Hence no new recommendation was made this month.

However, we did profit booking in GIPCL. We recommended buying GIPCL on November 22, 2023, when it was trading at a price-to-book (PB) multiple of 0.8 at Rs 155.4. We booked a profit on July 19, 2024, at Rs 239, as the stock’s valuation had become relatively stretched, trading at a PB multiple of 1.13, yielding a gain of 53.80%.

Currently, we have 9 active positions out of which 8 are trading above the recommended price. Our strategy currently boasts a strike rate of 90%, with an average portfolio gain of 20.40% with the SAIL being the highest gainer in the portfolio with a gain of 66.74%. 
We appreciate your continued engagement with the Value Pick portfolio and look forward to sharing more such opportunities with you in the months ahead. Stay tuned…

Thank you!"

2024-08-03 07:34:02+00:00,-1001156495705,"In July, the Nifty index experienced a notable increase of 3.92%. The month was marked by significant volatility, especially around Budget Day. Initially, Nifty's performance was slow and sideways, but mid-month saw increased volatility and price momentum, with several major gap ups and gap downs. On the other hand, Bank Nifty moved mostly sideways with low momentum, creating a divergence between the two indices and resulting in intraday momentum traps.

Index Buying Strategy Results
We made 16 recommendations in July under our Index Buying Strategy. 11 of them were winners and 5 were losers, achieving an overall strike rate of 69%. The strategy achieved an average gain of 15.80% and yielded a total profit of ₹8,665 for 1 lot traded. This success was attributed to a sound risk management strategy, with the winners boasting an average gain of 29.07%, while the losers incurred an average loss of 26.00%.

Among the 16 recommendations:
Bank Nifty: 6 recommendations (5 winners, 1 loser)
Fin Nifty: 1 recommendation (1 winner)
Nifty: 7 recommendations (4 winners, 2 hit stop loss, 1 TSL)
Midcap Nifty: 2 recommendations (1 winner, 1 loser)

August Strategy and Outlook
For the coming month, we will adopt a more cautious approach due to significant global cues that could create major gaps at market open. These gaps may result in less momentum throughout the day. To navigate these conditions, we will adjust our strategy to better suit a sideways market and focus on identifying the right moments for momentum. If market conditions remain favorable, we will aim to capture major moves in intraday trading.

Our goal is to remain adaptable and responsive to market changes, ensuring we continue to deliver strong results for you. As we look ahead to the coming month, we remain optimistic and determined to sustain the momentum, aiming for strong movements. Our commitment to navigating market fluctuations with a strategic approach remains unwavering, providing hope for continued success.

We appreciate your trust in our strategy and look forward to delivering another successful month."

2024-08-03 06:57:27+00:00,-1001156495705,"Nifty crossed the psychological 25,000 mark and hit a new life time high of 25078.  It ended July with gains of 3.92% marking second consecutive monthly gain. The global market's continued positive strength bolstered domestic indices in July. Let’s see if this trend sustains in August. 

In our Positional Stock Option Segment Strategy, we shared 18 recommendations, resulting in 10 gains and 8 losses. This approach yielded profitable trades with a 55.5% strike rate and an average gain of 3.42%, concluding with a total gain of Rs. 18,783.

Some stock options remained in a narrow range, prompting us to exit positions to avoid theta decay. We consistently maintained a proper risk-reward ratio to safeguard the capital. Towards the end of the month, higher volatility and increased IVs led some profits to turn into losses. We would be looking for better opportunities in stocks that align with sector performances.

In light of the possibility of a bidirectional market trend, picking stocks will be crucial in the upcoming month. We thank you for being a part of our Positional Stock Option strategy.

During July 2024, small-cap and mid-cap stocks experienced significant pressure, culminating on the final budget day. On July 23, 2024, the Nifty Smallcap 100 and Nifty Midcap 100 indices saw intraday declines of 5.4% and 3.88%, respectively, as the budget did not meet market expectations. Despite a recovery later on that day, the sharp decline prompted us to exit positions in certain stocks.

Now let us examine the performance of our strategy for the month…
We issued recommendations for three stocks within our Delivery Trading Picks. However, we exited both positions as they hit the stop-loss level amid high volatility on budget day.

We have recommended 78 stocks employing this strategy to date, with 4 of these trades still active. We are pleased to report a success rate of 53% with 41 out of 78 trades showing positive gains. Two of our recommended stocks (VMart & Sansera Engineering) have delivered returns of over 37% each within 2 months.
The average gain for this strategy stands at approximately 5.37%, achieved within an average holding period of merely 44 days. When annualized, this equates to a remarkable average gain of approximately 44%. Our overall average gain was significantly impacted on account of stocks hitting stop-loss levels due to high volatility on election result day and final budget day. We are currently refining our models to optimize them to withstand high volatility environment. 

We stay committed to providing you with the precise entry price, and stop-loss level. Since we base our strategy on momentum, predicting the target price might lead to early exits. So, we update the exit price as soon as the momentum slows down. However, the maximum holding period for this stock is three months.

Our primary objective is to maximize the potential for enhancing your investments and consistently aiming to outperform the benchmark index, regardless of market conditions. We invite you to join us in this journey to seize short-term opportunities and optimize your investments.

Here’s the performance of all recommendations closed till July 2024."
